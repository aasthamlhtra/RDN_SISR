# RDN_SISR
This repository contains the implementation and experimentation of a Residual Dense Network (RDN) for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our work is based on the architecture proposed by Y. Zhang et al., with architectural modifications and performance evaluation using the DIV2K and standard benchmark datasets.
